# Aalto_C_2018
### Week 1 - Introduction
* [Task 1.4 Own Program](Task1_4_Own_Program/README.md) - Learn how to write, compile and test a program in your own environment.
* [Task 1.5 Vector function](Task1_5_Vector_Function/README.md) - Learn how to write a function that has a few parameters.

### Week 2 - Inputs and outputs
Some conversion types:

* %d: (int) -- integer in decimal format
* %u: (unsigned int) -- unsigned integer in decimal format
* %o: (unsigned int) -- octal number
* %x, %X: (unsigned int) -- hexadecimal number, using either lowercase letters (former) or uppercase letters (latter)
* %c: (int) -- single character based on the used character encoding (e.g., ASCII), as discussed earlier with the character constants.
* %s: (char*) -- string. We will take a more detailed look into strings in the next section.
* %f: (double) -- floating point number (format: n.nnnnnn). Default number of decimals included in output is 6.
* %e, %E: (double) -- floating point number (format: n.nnnnnnE+-xx)
* %g, %G: (double) -- choose either %f or %e format, depending on the value of exponent.

Tasks:
* [Task 2.3 Calculator](Task2_3_Calculator/README.md) - Learn how to use conditional statements and formatted input and output using *scanf* and *printf*.

### Week 8 - Binary operators
* [Task 8.1 Bit manipulation I](Task8_1_Bitwise/) - Getting familiar with basic bitwise operations.
* [Task 8.2 Bit manipulation II](Task8_2_Bitmanipulation/README.md) - Getting familiar with basic bitwise operations.
* [Task 8.3 Bitmasks](Task8_3_Bitmasks/README.md) - Operating on selected bit or set of bits.
* [Task 8.4 TCP header](Task8_4_TCP_Header/README.md) - TCP header.
* [Task 8.5 XOR Cipher](Task8_5_XOR_Cipher/README.md) - Get familiar with bitwise operation with longer data types.
